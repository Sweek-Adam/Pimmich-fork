- **Voice Control:** Control your frame with voice commands like *"Magic Frame, next photo"* or *"Magic Frame, play Vacation playlist"*.
- **Content Management:**
    - **Playlists:** Create virtual albums, reorder photos with drag-and-drop, and launch themed slideshows with a dynamic title screen (photo jumble on a corkboard background).
    - **Favorites:** Mark your favorite photos to make them appear more often.
    - **Captions:** Add custom text to your photos and postcards.

#### 🌐 **Connectivity & Interactions**

## 🚀 Installation

### Installation from the Git Repository

#### ✅ Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi (model 3B+, 4, or 5 recommended) with Raspberry Pi OS Desktop (64-bit).
- An SD card, a power supply, a screen.
- An Internet connection.

#### 📝 Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**
    Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sweek-Adam/Pimmich-fork.git pimmich
    cd pimmich
    ```

2.  **Run the installation script**
    This script installs all dependencies, configures the environment, and prepares for automatic startup.
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

This script installs system and Python dependencies, sets up the environment, and configures auto-start of the slideshow.

### 🔑 Get Your Immich API Token

1. Log into your Immich web interface  
2. Go to **Account Settings**

Click your profile icon (top-right), then choose **Account Settings**.

3. Generate a new API key  
In the **API Key** section, click **Generate new API Key** and give it a name (e.g., `PimmichFrame`).

⚠️ Once the token is shown, **copy it immediately** — you won’t be able to see it again. If lost, you’ll need to generate a new one.

🔒 We recommend creating a dedicated Immich account for the photo frame, with access to a single shared album.

### Connect to Pimmich

From a web browser on another device, access:

```

## ⚙️ Configuration Interface

### Slideshow Settings

Here, you can set the display time per photo (minimum ~10s, due to background blur processing for portrait images) and define active hours for the slideshow.

### Photo Import Settings

Choose between importing from an Immich album or a USB stick, and manage downloaded files.
